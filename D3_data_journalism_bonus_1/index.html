            <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Demographic Factors</h3>
            <p>
              In the chart indicated above, we take a closer look at the
              correlations between health risks and demographic factors. In particular, we are
              looking at the corelation between the demographic factors of those reported to be living in
              poverty and age and the health risk factors of the % of those who smoke and the % of those
              with health insurance.
            </p>

            <p>
              By clicking on the axis labels, you can easily see the correlation between these factors. The
              default plot shows the relationship between the percentage of those who smoke compared to the 
              percentage of those living in poverty. By selecting the average age, we can see the relationship
              between the percentage of those who smoke and those and the average age of residents living in 
              that particular state. You can also select the Y axis labels to see the relationship between
              the percentage of those with insurance as compared to the percentage of those living in poverty
              or the average age.
            </p>

            <p>
              So what do you think? Have you clicked on the labels? Did you see any corelations? I saw a few.
              For example, there definitely appears to be a relationship between the percentage of those who 
              smoke as compared to those living in poverty. As you can see, smoking percentages are 
              definitely higher for those states that have a higher poverty rate.
