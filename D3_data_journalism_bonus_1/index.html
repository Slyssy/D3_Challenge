            <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h3>
            <p>
              In the chart indicated above, we take a closer look at the
              correlations between smoking and poverty. In particular, we are
              looking at the corelation between those reported to be living in
              poverty and those reported to smoke.
            </p>

            <p>
              There does appear to be a correlation between the percent of those
              reported to smoke and the percent living in poverty. As you can
              see, states with higher reported poverty levels also tend to have
              a higher number of residents that smoke. Additionally, a third
              piece of information was used in constructing this chart. The
              bubble sizes are determined by the reported average income. The
              smaller the reported income, the smaller the bubble.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are obviuous limitations to this data; however. First, we do
              not know what they mean when they say "smoke". Are they referring
              to smoking tobacco or any type of smoking? Also, does this data
              include the use of any tobacco products such as chewing tobacco,
              or they only looking at those that smoke cigarrettes. Finally, do
              these numbers include those that might use electronic cigarrettes.
              That being said, there does appear to be evidence that those
              states reporting a higher number of smokers also report higher
              number of residents living in poverty.
